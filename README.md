# AES128
A pure python implementation of AES128

secret_message is an example of a text file that can be encrypted. Other files probably can be encrypted too, but I have not tested this extensively for this commit. Feel free to change the contents of the secret_message and even try encrypting other files instead. When the program asks for the file you do not need to specify the path, but make sure you specify the full file name. For example, secret_message would be secret_message.txt

Enjoy!
